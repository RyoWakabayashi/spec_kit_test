## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Phase 2 - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Phase 2 - Depends on US2 (uses DifficultyLevel)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 
  - Requires: Foundational phase (DifficultyLevel, MovementPattern modules exist)
  - Provides: Enemy bullet firing and collision system
  - Independent: Can be tested and deployed without US2 or US3

- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 
  - Requires: Foundational phase + US1 (for enemy bullet fire_interval_ms)
  - Provides: Difficulty scaling system
  - Independent: Can be tested separately (difficulty changes without complex patterns)

- **User Story 3 (P3)**: 
  - Requires: Foundational phase + US2 (uses DifficultyLevel.movement_patterns)
  - Provides: Complex enemy movement patterns
  - Independent: Can be tested separately (patterns work at any difficulty level)

### Within Each User Story

For all user stories:
1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. Core entity functions before integration
3. Game loop integration after entity functions
4. UI/rendering updates last
5. Story validation before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T004 (DifficultyLevel module) || T005 (MovementPattern module)
- T006 (DifficultyLevel test) || T007 (MovementPattern test)
- T008 (State extension) must complete before T010
- T009 (Enemy extension) must complete before T010

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T011 || T012 (tests can be written in parallel)
- After T013-T018 complete: T019 (test execution)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T020 || T021 (tests in parallel)
- T022-T024 (DifficultyLevel functions in sequence)
- T025 || T026 (State functions in parallel)
- T027 || T028 (State updates in parallel)
- T029 || T030 (Enemy functions in parallel)
- T031-T036 (integration tasks in sequence)
- T037 (test execution)

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- T038 || T039 (tests in parallel)
- T040-T044 (pattern implementations can be parallel after T040)
- T046 || T047 (Enemy functions in parallel)
- T048-T052 (integration tasks)

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- T053-T059 all can run in parallel
- T060-T064 must run in sequence (format → test → validate)

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Foundational Phase (Phase 2)

Developer A and Developer B can work in parallel:

```bash
# Developer A:
Task T004: Create DifficultyLevel module
Task T006: Create DifficultyLevel test
Task T008: Extend State module

# Developer B (parallel):
Task T005: Create MovementPattern module
Task T007: Create MovementPattern test
Task T009: Extend Enemy module

# Then sync for:
Task T010: Run foundation tests
```

### Example 2: User Story 3 Movement Patterns

Multiple pattern implementations can be done in parallel:

```bash
# Developer A:
Task T041: Implement apply_linear
Task T043: Implement apply_sine_wave

# Developer B (parallel):
Task T042: Implement apply_zigzag
Task T044: Implement apply_circular

# Both merge into:
Task T045: Implement clamp_to_bounds
```

### Example 3: Polish Phase

Many polish tasks are independent:

```bash
# Developer A:
Task T053: Performance monitoring
Task T055: Edge case handling
Task T059: Documentation updates

# Developer B (parallel):
Task T054: Telemetry events
Task T056: Entity count limits
Task T057-T058: Validation functions
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)

**Recommended MVP**: User Story 1 ONLY (Phase 3)

**Why**: 
- US1 adds immediate gameplay value (enemy bullets)
- US1 is fully independent and testable
- US1 provides foundation for difficulty scaling
- Can validate core game mechanics before adding complexity

**MVP Deliverable**:
- Enemies fire bullets at players
- Player loses when hit by enemy bullet
- Basic challenge added to existing game

### Incremental Delivery

**Release 1 (MVP)**: User Story 1
- Feature: Enemy bullet firing
- Value: Adds challenge to gameplay
- Risk: Low - isolated feature

**Release 2**: User Story 1 + User Story 2
- Feature: Difficulty scaling over time
- Value: Progressive challenge, longer engagement
- Risk: Medium - timing and balance tuning needed

**Release 3 (Full Feature)**: User Story 1 + 2 + 3
- Feature: Complex enemy movement patterns
- Value: Visual variety, advanced gameplay
- Risk: Medium - performance and pattern tuning

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: 
- DifficultyLevel: Level progression, config retrieval
- MovementPattern: Mathematical correctness of each pattern
- Enemy: Difficulty-aware creation, health scaling
- State: Difficulty update logic

**Integration Tests**:
- LiveView: Difficulty increases every 10 seconds
- LiveView: Enemy spawn rate changes with difficulty
- LiveView: Movement patterns change with difficulty

**Performance Tests**:
- Game tick processing < 16ms at max difficulty (level 10+)
- 20 enemies + 100 bullets without frame drops

**Manual Testing Scenarios** (from quickstart.md):
- Play for 30+ seconds, observe difficulty progression
- Verify level-up notification appears
- Confirm enemy behavior changes are visible
- Check game over on enemy bullet collision

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 64
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 7 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1): 9 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2): 18 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3): 15 tasks
- Phase 6 (Polish): 12 tasks

**Tasks per User Story**:
- User Story 1 (敵の弾発射機能): 9 tasks
- User Story 2 (難易度段階的上昇): 18 tasks
- User Story 3 (複雑な移動パターン): 15 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 27 tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- ✅ US1: Enemy bullets fire, move, and collide - independently testable
- ✅ US2: Difficulty scales every 10s - independently testable
- ✅ US3: Movement patterns change by level - independently testable

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (Phase 3) = 9 tasks

**Estimated Effort**:
- Phase 1-2 (Setup + Foundation): 2-3 hours
- Phase 3 (US1 - MVP): 3-4 hours
- Phase 4 (US2): 4-5 hours
- Phase 5 (US3): 3-4 hours
- Phase 6 (Polish): 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 14-19 hours
