# Specification Quality Checklist: 敵難易度の段階的スケーリング

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025年10月19日
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items complete

### Content Quality Review

- ✅ Specification is technology-agnostic and focuses on user experience
- ✅ Written in plain language suitable for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review

- ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ 7 success criteria defined with specific, measurable metrics
- ✅ All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of Phoenix, Elixir, or implementation details)
- ✅ 3 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified
- ✅ 10 assumptions clearly documented

### Feature Readiness Review

- ✅ User Story 1 (P1): Enemy bullet firing - Core challenge mechanic
- ✅ User Story 2 (P2): Time-based difficulty scaling - Progressive engagement
- ✅ User Story 3 (P3): Complex enemy movement patterns - Visual variety
- ✅ All user stories are independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria cover performance (SC-002, SC-005), user experience (SC-001, SC-004, SC-007), and engagement (SC-006)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All requirements are clear and actionable
- No clarifications needed from stakeholders
- Feature scope is well-defined and builds upon existing shooter game (001-browser-shooter-game)
