RyoWakabayashi: Follow instructions in [speckit.tasks.prompt.md](file://./speck_kit_test/.github/prompts/speckit.tasks.prompt.md).

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you generate the tasks.md file following the SpecKit instructions. Let me start by running the prerequisites check and loading the design documents. 

Ran terminal command: .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json

Now let me load all the available design documents: 

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/plan.md) の読み取り

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/spec.md) の読み取り

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/data-model.md) の読み取り

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/research.md) の読み取り

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/quickstart.md) の読み取り

Now let me check if there are any contracts defined: 

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/contracts) の読み取り

[](file://./speck_kit_test/specs/001-browser-shooter-game/contracts/liveview-events.md) の読み取り

Now let me check for the tasks template: 

[](file://./speck_kit_test/.specify/templates/tasks-template.md) の読み取り

Perfect! Now I have all the necessary information. Let me generate the tasks.md file based on the design documents and the template structure. I'll organize tasks by user story as per the instructions.

Let me fix the markdown linting errors:

Perfect! Now let me create a summary report:

## ✅ Tasks Generation Complete

I've successfully generated the tasks.md file for the browser shooter game feature at:

**File Location**: tasks.md

## 📊 Summary Report

### Task Count Breakdown

- **Total Tasks**: 83
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 7 tasks - Project initialization with mise, Phoenix, directories
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 9 tasks - Core game entities and infrastructure ⚠️ BLOCKS ALL USER STORIES
- **Phase 3 (US1 - ゲーム開始とプレイ)**: 21 tasks - Start screen, mouse controls, shooting
- **Phase 4 (US2 - 敵との戦闘とスコアシステム)**: 22 tasks - Enemies, collisions, score, game over
- **Phase 5 (US3 - スコア保存と履歴)**: 9 tasks - LocalStorage persistence, high score display
- **Phase 6 (Polish & Cross-Cutting)**: 13 tasks - Optimization, validation, documentation

### Parallel Opportunities

**42 tasks marked [P]** can run in parallel within their respective phases:

- Setup: 4 parallel tasks (directories, config, CSS, PubSub)
- Foundational: 7 parallel tasks (entity structs, collision tests, hooks registration)
- US1: 11 parallel tasks (tests, hooks, player logic, rendering)
- US2: 13 parallel tasks (tests, spawner, enemy logic, UI components)
- US3: 6 parallel tasks (tests, storage hook, UI updates)
- Polish: 11 parallel tasks (optimization, documentation, testing)

### Independent Test Criteria

Each user story can be independently validated:

1. **US1 (MVP)**: Can start game from start screen, move player with mouse, fire bullets on click
2. **US2 (Full Game)**: Enemies appear and move, collisions detect properly, score updates, game over triggers on hit or timeout
3. **US3 (Persistence)**: High score saves to LocalStorage on game over, displays on start screen after reload

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)**

- Total tasks: 37 tasks
- Estimated time: ~14 hours
- Deliverable: Playable game with start screen, mouse controls, and shooting mechanics

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy Options

### Option 1: Sequential (Solo Developer)

1. Setup (7 tasks) → ~2 hours
2. Foundational (9 tasks) → ~4 hours ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKPOINT
3. US1 (21 tasks) → ~8 hours → **MVP DEMO**
4. US2 (22 tasks) → ~10 hours → **FULL GAME DEMO**
5. US3 (9 tasks) → ~4 hours → **COMPLETE FEATURE**
6. Polish (13 tasks) → ~4 hours

**Total**: ~32 hours

### Option 2: Parallel (3 Developers)

1. All: Setup + Foundational → ~6 hours ⚠️ SYNC POINT
2. Split work:
   - Dev A: US1 (8 hours)
   - Dev B: US2 prep (6 hours)
   - Dev C: US3 prep (4 hours)
3. Integration: US2 + US3 final integration → ~6 hours
4. All: Polish in parallel → ~2 hours

**Total**: ~16 hours with 3 developers

## ✅ Format Validation

All tasks follow the required checklist format:

```markdown
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Examples from generated file**:

- ✅ `- [ ] T001 Verify mise installation and install Elixir/Erlang per quickstart.md`
- ✅ `- [ ] T004 [P] Configure PubSub in shooter_game/lib/shooter_game/application.ex`
- ✅ `- [ ] T019 [P] [US1] Write unit test for Player.move_to/3 in shooter_game/test/shooter_game/game/player_test.exs`
- ✅ `- [ ] T049 [US2] Implement Collision.detect_player_bullet_enemy_collisions/1 in shooter_game/lib/shooter_game/game/collision.ex`

All tasks include:

- ✅ Checkbox (`- [ ]`)
- ✅ Sequential Task ID (T001-T083)
- ✅ [P] marker where applicable (42 tasks)
- ✅ [US1/US2/US3] story label for user story tasks
- ✅ Clear description with exact file paths

## 🔗 Dependencies Mapped

### Critical Dependencies

1. **Setup → Foundational**: Must complete T001-T007 before T008-T016
2. **Foundational → All User Stories**: T008-T016 BLOCKS T017+ (all user stories)
3. **US1 → US2**: US2 needs game loop and bullet system from US1
4. **US2 → US3**: US3 needs game_over state from US2 for save trigger

### Independent Work Streams

After Foundational phase completes:

- US1 core implementation (player, bullets, rendering)
- US2 enemy/spawner logic (can prep in parallel)
- US3 storage hook (fully independent, just needs game_over integration)

---

## 📦 Deliverables

The generated tasks.md includes:

✅ All 83 tasks organized by user story
✅ Clear phase structure with checkpoints
✅ Dependency graph and execution order
✅ Parallel execution examples
✅ MVP definition (37 tasks)
✅ Implementation strategy for solo and team
✅ Independent test criteria per story
✅ Time estimates per phase
✅ Complete file path references

The file is immediately executable - each task is specific enough for implementation without additional context.
